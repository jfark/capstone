						<div>
							<p>A space for you! That is, if you're a teen. We want you teens to take art seriously, to take your own capability for making art (of any kind! however you define it!) seriously... We want you to hang out with the Barnes Foundation collection, to pick out and learn more about your favorites, and to do more than imagine your point of view amongst them, but to add it into the mix yourself.</p>

							<h2>What is the Barnes Foundation?</h2>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>The Barnes Foundation holds some of the world’s most important impressionist, post-impressionist, and modern paintings, including works by Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso. This Philadelphia art institution was chartered by Albert C. Barnes (1872–1951) in 1922 to teach people from all walks of life how to look at art.</p>

							<h2>What is the Mission of the Barnes Witz?</h2>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>The Barnes Witz wants you teens to have special access to this eclectic and meaningful collection because we know that each of you are a whole world unto yourself, and, if you trust yourself to create what you want to in this world, you will go far. You don't need to have any special skills to play, and that's how much of the greatest art in the world has been created — through play! So take a spin through the works of the Barnes Foundation, and bring your own unique voice to the table.</p>

							<h2>How was this website built?</h2>
						</div>
						<div>
							<p>This website was created by a student of the Minneapolis College of Art and Design's online Masters of Graphic & Web Design. The site was built using the 3 fundamental components for website design which are (think a stool that is sturdy on 3 legs): HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (in this case, specifically Vue).
